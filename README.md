# CIS_CRUD_APP

This application was started by importing the base angular app
I had to do lots of updates from the base to get to the current working version of angular
I implemented an account manager which lets you add, remove, view, and edit permission level of an account.
I also implemented a post ability which lets a user create, remove, edit and view post.
I used C# controllers to manage the backend API.
The database is a static object on the backend for now.
